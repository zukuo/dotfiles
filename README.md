# Zukuo's Dotfiles

Here are a collection of my dotfiles, all mainly from linux. Which can be used on a range of systems, I've personally only ever used them for Arch Linux and MacOS.

**The most important dots are:**
- My ZSH config (shell)
- My Neovim config (editor)
- My Alacritty config (terminal)

There may be some required apps in order to use the dots to the full potential, but they should be commented in the actual dots themselves.
